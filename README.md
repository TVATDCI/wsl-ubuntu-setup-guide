## **7. Difference Between Zsh and Neovim**

- **Zsh** is an interactive shell for running commands, while **Neovim** is a powerful text editor.
- **Zsh** helps with command-line efficiency, auto-suggestions, and plugins.
- **Neovim** is optimized for coding, with syntax highlighting, plugins, and customization.
- **Using Both:** You can configure **Neovim as your Zsh editor** by setting:
  ```bash
  export EDITOR=nvim
  ```

- **List files in home directory:**
  ```bash
  ls -la ~
  ```
- **Check installed Node.js version:**
  ```bash
  node -v
  ```
- **Display system info using Neofetch:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y neofetch
  neofetch
  ```

## **9. Accessing Ubuntu Files from Windows**

Your Ubuntu files are stored inside WSL. You can access them in **Windows File Explorer** by typing:

```plaintext
\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\<your-UNIX-username>
```
=======
  This allows you to edit files inside your terminal seamlessly.


**Pros:**
‚úÖ Neovim as default editor in Zsh streamlines workflow.
‚úÖ Zsh enhances command-line experience.


```plaintext
C:\Users\YourWindowsUsername\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited...\LocalState\rootfs\home\<your-UNIX-username>
```
=======
**Cons:**
‚ùå Using both might be overwhelming for beginners.
‚ùå Requires time to configure properly.

‚úÖ **Now you have the perfect dual-terminal setup: Windows for daily tasks & Ubuntu for development!** üöÄ
