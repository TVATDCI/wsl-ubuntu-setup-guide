   syntax on
   colorscheme gruvbox
   set number
   ```

4. Save and exit **(Esc, then type `:wq`)**.

## **6. Sync VS Code Extensions Between Windows and WSL**

To use the same extensions in both environments:

1. Open **VS Code on Windows**.
2. Sign in to your **GitHub or Microsoft account** to enable **Settings Sync**.
3. Open **VS Code inside WSL** using:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
4. Sign in again and **enable syncing**.
5. Your extensions and settings should now be synced!

## **7. Difference Between Zsh and Neovim**

- **Zsh** is an interactive shell for running commands, while **Neovim** is a powerful text editor.
- **Zsh** helps with command-line efficiency, auto-suggestions, and plugins.
- **Neovim** is optimized for coding, with syntax highlighting, plugins, and customization.
- **Using Both:** You can configure **Neovim as your Zsh editor** by setting:
  ```bash
  export EDITOR=nvim
  ```
  This allows you to edit files inside your terminal seamlessly.

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Neovim as default editor in Zsh streamlines workflow.
‚úÖ Zsh enhances command-line experience.

**Cons:**
‚ùå Using both might be overwhelming for beginners.
‚ùå Requires time to configure properly.

‚úÖ **Now you have the perfect dual-terminal setup: Windows for daily tasks & Ubuntu for development!** üöÄ

Since you're often using multiple terminal tabs for your full-stack development, tmux is a great addition. Here‚Äôs why:

### Split Your Terminal Efficiently

You can divide your terminal into multiple panes and navigate between them easily.
Example use case: Have backend logs on one side and your frontend dev server on another.

### Persistent Sessions

If you close your terminal by mistake, your running processes (like servers, databases, etc.) won‚Äôt die! You can reattach to them.

### Better Navigation & Productivity

You don‚Äôt have to constantly open and close new terminal tabs.
Instead, just split panes inside tmux and jump between them with key bindings.

Since you already have Zsh + Oh My Zsh + Powerlevel10k, I‚Äôd add tmux and configure it to work seamlessly with your current setup.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Install tmux**

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install tmux -y
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure tmux for a Better Experience**
Create a `~/.tmux.conf` file to customize it:

```sh
nano ~/.tmux.conf
```

Paste the following configuration:

```sh
# Set better keybindings

set -g mouse on # Enable mouse support for easier pane resizing
unbind C-b # Unbind default tmux prefix (Ctrl+b)
set -g prefix C-a # Set "Ctrl + a" as the new prefix (easier to use)
bind C-a send-prefix # Let you send Ctrl+A to applications if needed

# Split panes with shortcuts

bind | split-window -h # Ctrl+A then | ‚Üí Split horizontally
bind - split-window -v # Ctrl+A then - ‚Üí Split vertically

# Switch panes with arrow keys

bind -r Left select-pane -L
bind -r Right select-pane -R
bind -r Up select-pane -U
bind -r Down select-pane -D

# Resize panes with Shift + Arrow keys

bind -r S-Left resize-pane -L 5
bind -r S-Right resize-pane -R 5
bind -r S-Up resize-pane -U 5
bind -r S-Down resize-pane -D 5

# Reload config with Ctrl+A then r

bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display-message "Tmux config reloaded!"
```

Save & exit (**Ctrl+X ‚Üí Y ‚Üí Enter**).

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Reload tmux Configuration**

```sh
tmux source ~/.tmux.conf
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Start a New tmux Session**

```sh
tmux
```

Now, try these:

- **Split panes:**
  - `Ctrl + A` then `|` (vertical split)
  - `Ctrl + A` then `-` (horizontal split)
- **Switch between panes:** `Ctrl + A` then arrow keys
- **Resize panes:** Shift + Arrow keys
- **Detach from tmux (without closing it):** `Ctrl + A` then `D`
- **Reattach to your session after closing the terminal:**
  ```sh
  tmux attach-session -t 0
  ```
